RSA-encryption
==============

Using the RSA encryption technique to create an encryption program to encrypt text.

------------------------------

Using Python 3, I have created a prime number generator using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
This generator is used in the main 'encryption.py' file to create a list of prime numbers to be used in encrypting plaintext using the RSA encryption algorithm.

The algorithm help document used for this encryption can be found here: http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/resources/real-world/RSA.pdf
